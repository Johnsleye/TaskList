# TaskList
I created this task list with vanilla Javascript.
You can add task and remove task
The tasks are saved into the local storage unless it is deleted, it stays everytime the DOM is reloaded.
The task list can be filtered incase there are so many tasks stored and you need to search for a particular task.
